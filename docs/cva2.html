<h3>Wright Map</h3>
<p>In Calibration #2, we used <strong>a restricted response data from
888 students in grades 2-5 in public schools for 81 items</strong>,
using the Rasch model. The WrightMap shows item difficulty and ability
estimates on the logit scale. Items are ordered by difficulty on the
x-axis.</p>
<p>Consistent with the results with the whole sample (calibration #1),
the map visually shows that no items exist for the very top and the very
bottom ends of the ability distribution along the y-axis.</p>

</div>
<div id="item-difficulty" class="section level3">
<h3>Item Difficulty</h3>
<p>Item difficulty ranged from -1.43 to 1.5 logits, with mean = -0.16
and SD = -0.27.</p>

<p>A histogram and a boxplot below show the distribution of the item
difficulty estimates. Given that the mean of the student ability is
constrained to 0, the current CVA items as a set is relatively easier
with the median of -0.27. The red line in the boxplot shows the mean
item difficulty (-0.16).</p>

<div id="item-fit" class="section level3">
<h3>Item Fit</h3>
<p>Interestingly, all CVA items, including one misfitting item
(decorated = “quotation”) from Calibration #1, have infit values within
the acceptable range (0.75-1.33), indicating that they fit to the Rasch
model. In the Item Fit graph below, all except for one Infit value, are
located between the blue vertical lines. However, the “quotation” item
still has the highest infit value = 1.31 and its observed ICC looks
problematic.</p>
<p>Below are the ICCs for “quotation” (first graph), and the “critical”
(the second graph).</p>

<h3>Distractor Analysis</h3>
<p>In the discriminator analysis, students were divided into four groups
based on their total scores. The proportions of students in each groups
choosing a particular answer choice are shown in the last four
columns.</p>
<p>We expect that the majority of upper group to choose the correct
option. If a different option is more attractive to the upper group, the
item and its options should be flagged for review. For item 45
(decorated word = <strong>quotation</strong>), the answer choices
“example” and “symbol”are more attractive to all four groups.</p>
<p>Note that option <strong>zzz</strong> indicate “missing”. It includes
both missing by design (i.e., students did not get this item) as well as
missing as students did not answer.</p>
<p><strong>pBis</strong> indicates the point-biserial correlation
between that response and the total score with that item removed.</p>
