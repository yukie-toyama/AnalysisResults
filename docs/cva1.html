<h3>Wright Map</h3>
<p>We calibrated all available response data from 2336 students for 81
items, using the Rasch model. The WrightMap shows item difficulty and
ability estimates on the logit scale. Items are ordered by difficulty on
the x-axis. The map visually shows that no items exist for the very top
and the very bottom ends of the ability distribution along the y-axis.
This may be because the calibration sample includes students who are
outside of the target grade- / ability-levels (see Student Ability
section below).</p>

and SD = -0.46.</p>

<p>A histogram and a boxplot below show the distribution of the item
difficulty estimates. Given that the mean of the student ability is
constrained to 0, the current CVA items as a set is relatively easier
with the median of -0.46. The red line in the boxplot shows the mean
item difficulty (-0.35).</p>

<h3>Item Fit</h3>
<p>All CVA items except for one (decorated = “quotation”) have infit
values within the acceptable range (0.75-1.33), indicating that they fit
to the Rasch model. In the Item Fit graph below, all except for one
Infit value, are located between the blue vertical lines.</p>
<p>The misfitting item (“quotation”) is the most difficult item (1.54
logits) in the item set. The infit value of 1.35 indicates that the item
elicits responses that are more random than the model excepts.</p>
<p>The first expected score curve below shows the discrepancy between
the model-based ICC (item characteristic curve, in blue) and the
observed-ICC (in black) for the misfitting item (“quotation”). The
observed line indicates that the item does not discriminate the higher
ability from the lower-ability students; in fact, students with lower
ability estimates have slight better chance of success than students
with higher ability estimates.</p>
<p>The second curve is for the item with decorated word “critical”. The
Infit value for this item was 1.23, within the acceptable range,
although the the item doesn’t appear to be discriminating the middle
range of the ability distribution (around -1 to 1 logit).</p>
