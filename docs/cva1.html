<h3>Wright Map</h3>
<p>We calibrated <strong>all available response data from 2336 students
for 81 items</strong>, using the Rasch model. The WrightMap shows item
difficulty and ability estimates on the logit scale. Items are ordered
by difficulty on the x-axis. The map visually shows that no items exist
for the very top and the very bottom ends of the ability distribution
along the y-axis. This may be because the calibration sample includes
students who are outside of the target grade- / ability-levels (see
Student Ability section below).</p>

<p>A histogram and a boxplot below show the distribution of the item
difficulty estimates. Given that the mean of the student ability is
constrained to 0, the current CVA items as a set is relatively easier
with the median of -0.46. The red line in the boxplot shows the mean
item difficulty (-0.35).</p>

<h3>Item Fit</h3>
<p>All CVA items except for one (decorated = “quotation”) have infit
values within the acceptable range (0.75-1.33), indicating that they fit
to the Rasch model. In the Item Fit graph below, all except for one
Infit value, are located between the blue vertical lines.</p>
<p>The misfitting item (“quotation”) is the most difficult item (1.54
logits) in the item set. The infit value of 1.35 indicates that the item
elicits responses that are more random than the model excepts.</p>
<p>The first expected score curve below shows the discrepancy between
the model-based ICC (item characteristic curve, in blue) and the
observed-ICC (in black) for the misfitting item (“quotation”). The
observed line indicates that the item does not discriminate the higher
ability from the lower-ability students; in fact, students with lower
ability estimates have slight better chance of success than students
with higher ability estimates.</p>
<p>The second curve is for the item with decorated word “critical”. The
Infit value for this item was 1.23, within the acceptable range,
although the the item doesn’t appear to be discriminating the middle
range of the ability distribution (around -1 to 1 logit).</p>

<h3>Distractor Analysis</h3>
<p>In the discriminator analysis, students were divided into four groups
based on their total scores. The proportions of students in each groups
choosing a particular answer choice are shown in the last four
columns.</p>
<p>We expect that the majority of upper group to choose the correct
option. If a different option is more attractive to the upper group, the
item and its options should be flagged for review. For item 45
(decorated word = <strong>quotation</strong>), the answer choices
“example” and “symbol”are more attractive to all four groups.</p>
<p>Note that option <strong>zzz</strong> indicate “missing”. It includes
both missing by design (i.e., students did not get this item) as well as
missing as students did not answer.</p>
<p><strong>pBis</strong> indicates the point-biserial correlation
between that response and the total score with that item removed.</p>
